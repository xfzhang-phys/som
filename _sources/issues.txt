Reporting issues
================

Please report all problems and bugs directly at the GitHub issue page
`<https://github.com/krivenko/som/issues>`_.  In order to make it easier for me
to solve the issue please follow these guidelines:

#. In all cases specify which version of the application you are using. You can
   find the version number in the file ``CMakeLists.txt`` at the root of the
   application sources. It is also reported by CMake early in the configuartion
   process.

#. If you have a problem during the installation, give me information about
   your operating system and the compiler you are using. Include the outputs of
   the ``cmake`` and ``make`` commands as well as the ``CMakeCache.txt`` file
   which is in the build directory. Please include these outputs in a
   `gist <http://gist.github.com/>`_ file referenced in the issue.

#. If you are experiencing a problem during the execution of the application, provide
   a script, which allows to quickly reproduce the problem. If the problem is caused by
   a specific set of input data, please, consider providing the corresponding data file
   (preferably, as a TRIQS-compatible :ref:`HDF5-archive <hdf5_tutorial>`).

Thanks!
