Authors
=======

This analytic continuation program is written by Igor Krivenko (`accompanying paper <https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cpc.2019.01.021>`_,
`arXiv:1808.00603 <https://arxiv.org/abs/1808.00603>`_).

It is based on a method devised by Andrey S. Mishchenko and coauthors.

    `A. S. Mishchenko, N. V. Prokof’ev, A. Sakamoto, and B. V. Svistunov, Phys. Rev. B 62, 6317 <http://dx.doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevB.62.6317>`_

You can find a detailed description of the method in Chapter 14 of the Lecture Notes
from the Autumn School "Correlated Electrons: From Models to Materials".

Acknowledgements
================

I am very grateful to Malte Harland for extensive and thorough testing of the code
at late development stages.

I would also like to acknowledge support from the University of Hamburg, as well as
from the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft via the Project SFB-668
"Magnetismus vom Einzelatom zur Nanostruktur" (A3). Some large-scale tests have been
run on the JURECA HPC machine of the Forschungszentrum Jülich
(project "Continuous Time Quantum Monte Carlo for materials").

TRIQS
=====

It is highly recommended to get familiar with basic usage of the TRIQS library,
before starting to work with this program.

Here is a simple tutorial showing how to manipulate Green's Function objects of TRIQS
in Python scripts,
