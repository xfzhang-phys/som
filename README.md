This program is an optimized implementation of an analytic continuation
method proposed by Andrey S. Mishchenko. A detailed description of
the method can be found under
http://www.cond-mat.de/events/correl12/manuscripts/mishchenko.pdf

This project uses the TRIQS library version 2.2.x (SOM versions prior to 2.0 were based on TRIQS 1.4.2).
The TRIQS website is under https://triqs.github.io/triqs/.
